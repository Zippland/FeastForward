# FeastForward

## Overview
FeastForward is an Android application designed to bridge the gap between food surplus and scarcity by facilitating the donation and distribution of food.

## Features
- **Food Donation and Collection:** Connects donors with local food banks and community centers to ensure smooth transfer of excess food.
- **Expiration Tracker:** Scans and tracks the expiration dates of food items to minimize waste.
- **Recipe Finder:** Suggests recipes based on the ingredients available, helping you make the most of your kitchen supplies.
